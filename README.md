# üìö Geek Shelf 
Geek Shelf is a visually rich, React-based app for organizing what you've already watched or read ‚Äî across anime, movies, series, and books. Designed with a clean UI and calm ambient touches, it helps you build your own personal archive, not just another list.

With a serene, forest-inspired aesthetic, floating fireflies, glowing spirit animals, and smooth UI transitions, the app evokes a quiet, almost magical experience ‚Äî a digital reflection of a cozy, well-loved bookshelf.
